Programm allows you make operations with matrixes getting from files. In one file you can store only one matrix.

You can:
1) sum up two matrixes
2) multiple two matrixes
3) get determinant using split by column

Another ability is a getting reference information.

To sum up matrixes give key "a", names of files with matrixes and name of file with result.
For example: a matr1.txt matr2.txt res.txt

To multiple matrixes give key "m", names of files with matrixes and name of file with result.
For example: m matr1.txt matr2.txt res.txt

To get determinant give key "o", name of file with matrix and name of file with result.
For example: o matr1.txt res.txt

To get getting reference information give key "h", names of files with matrixes and name of file with result.
For example: h matr1.txt matr2.txt res.txt
